<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>Welcome, {{ $goonid }}, to the {{ $org }} organization, a place where hope goes to die in the dark recesses of the 'verse.</p>
<p>If you have properly given our lord and savior Christ Roberts his :10bux: tithe, you will have received an invitation to join the FLJK organization on the RSI forums.  You can access your invitations here: <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/account/organization/invitations">My Account Invitations</a></p>
<p>Note that you can only join the RSI organization if you have a "backer" account, which is obtained by pledging for an item in the RSI store.  A $5 ship skin is the cheapest thing you can purchase to gain "backer" status.</p>
<p>Now go get 'em, tiger!  Journey forth and earn yourself those swag goon posting merits!</p>
