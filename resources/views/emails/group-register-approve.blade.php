<p>Congratulations!  By the powers vested in MembershipBot by God Emperor Lowtax, your access codes for the system has been approved!</p>
<p>You are a new member of the {{ $group }} group.</p>
<p>You are now cleared to join your fellow spergs in talking about dicks and butts.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your GoonID is: {{ $goonid }}<br>
Your temporary password is: {{ $password }}</p>
<hr>
<p>Your GoonID is your login ID for all of our services, be it the forums, Jabber, Mumble, wiki, etc.  This will never change, although you do have the ability to change your display name on the forums. This and many initial how-to questions are outlined <a href="https://forums.goonrathi.com/index.php?/forum-4/announcement-6-how-do-i-jabber-mumble-wiki-sponsor-members-make-ops-that-are-too-big-make-poor-life-choices-in-general/">in this handy post!</a></p>
<p>The first thing you should do is <a href="https://forums.goonrathi.com/index.php?app=core&module=usercp&tab=core&area=email">visit your forum profile and change your password</a>.<br>
Your password for all of our services is the same, so if you ever forget your password, just reset it on the forums.</p>
<p>Your next step will be to log into the auth portal again and <a href="https://goonauth.goonrathi.com/games">join a game</a>.  We support multiple games on our system and some games may have different membership requirements, so you will need to go through another authentication cycle.  Just click the <a href="https://goonauth.goonrathi.com/games">"Join Game"</a> button and follow the directions.  If you are wondering why you can't see game specific forums, or why nobody will give you an invite to the guild, you most likely didn't complete this step.</p>
